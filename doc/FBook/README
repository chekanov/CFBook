Example showing how to create a histogram in Fortran and show it using DataMelt:
It is assumed that you have created C++ library by typing "make" in cmd_FBook/ 


1) make                    # compile program 
2) example.exe             # run to cteate fortran.xml with histogram files 
3) dmelt_batch.sh cpp.xml  # show histogram in DataMelt
