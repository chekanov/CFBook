<P>
<b>CFBook</b> is a C++/FORTRAN library providing
histogram booking and related facilities.
1D and 2D Histograms can be booked and filled in either C++ or FORTRAN
programs.
The uniform XML output with histograms
can be read by jHepWork.

<p>
CFBook is distributed under the GNU.
This distribution contains the code
required to build the 2 libraries: cbook (to be linked with C++
code) and fbook (to be linked with FORTRAN),
as well as  a few example programs.

<p>
Compile the C++ library from the cmd_CBook directory (type make) <br> 
Compile the FORTRAN library from the cmd_FBook directory (type make) 

<p>
Compile and run examples in the directories: doc/CBook (for C++ programs)
or doc/FBook (for FORTRAN programs)  
<p>

The examples will produce XML output files with histograms: cpp.xml
(filled by C++ example) and fortran.xml (filled by  fortran example).
Plot histograms using

(Class HBook, see examples in hbook.py and hbook2D.py).





<P>
CFBook is based on HCL package   (G.Barrand, OpenScientist package) and GBook package
(T.Sjostrand and M.Seymour)
